ðŸ”¹ Types of Linked Lists

Singly Linked List (SLL)

Node = data + pointer to next

Circular Linked List (CLL)

Last node points back to head

Doubly Linked List (DLL)

Node = data + previous pointer + next pointer

ðŸ”¹ Operations on Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List (SLL)

Creation

Traversal (Display)

Length (Count nodes)

Insertion

At Beginning

At End

At Position

Deletion

At Beginning

At End

At Position

Searching (find element)

Reversing the list

Concatenation (joining two lists)

2. Circular Linked List (CLL)

Creation

Traversal (loop stops when we return to head)

Insertion

At Beginning

At End

At Position

Deletion

At Beginning

At End

At Position

Reversing

Concatenation

3. Doubly Linked List (DLL)

Creation

Traversal (forward & backward)

Insertion

At Beginning

At End

At Position

Deletion

At Beginning

At End

At Position

Reversing (using prev & next links)

Concatenation

ðŸ”¹ Applications of Linked Lists

Dynamic memory allocation (no fixed size like arrays).

Implementation of Stacks & Queues.

Representing polynomials and long integers.

Adjacency lists in graphs.

Symbol tables in compilers.
